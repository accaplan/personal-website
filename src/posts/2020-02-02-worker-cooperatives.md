I will mostly be writing about what I am thinking about, what I am up to, what I am making.

## What is up with all of my projects?

[How to Make Space](https://www.howtomake.space) is the newest of my web project. I have developed it from open source code. It is a statically served websites, and infinitely scalable.

The project is a further expansion of my role as an architect and my push for more design-focused social entrepreneurs. For this I responded to a need I found to create cooperatives for making spaces and places that not only house but also expand the human spirit. I will be inviting people to contribute tutorials. Profits will fund my non-profit work as [Infinite Places](https://www.infiniteplaces.org). As result I can expand research into:

- Autonomy and Independence
- Education, Training, and Information
- Cooperation AmongÂ Cooperatives
- Concern for Community
- Making as anarchy
