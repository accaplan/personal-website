## What is up with all of my projects?

[How to Make Space](https://www.howtomake.space) is the newest of my website. I built it off of open source code. It is statically served, and infinitely scalable.

The project is an expansion of my role as an architect. We need more design social entrepreneurs to create entreprises for making spaces that expand the human spirit. I will be inviting people to contribute tutorials. Profits will fund my non-profit work as [Infinite Places](https://www.infiniteplaces.org). As result I can expand research into.

- Autonomy and Independence
- Education, Training, and Information
- Cooperation AmongÂ Cooperatives
- Concern for Community
- Making as anarchy
